# Bot1448
This is the Git repo for Bot1448. It contains all the source code for the bot. The bot is published under an MIT License, so you can use its code as long as you provide proper credit to the creator (aka me).

I made this especially for all those people out there who think my bot is unsafe.

## v2.1.0
This is a compulsory update and fixes most existing update bugs. The list of bugs includes a bug in the installer, so you'll have to either re-install the bot using a new installer or let the bot automatically do this for you (which it will if you enable the auto-updater).

### Overview
v2.1.0 is a significant update because it officially removes the *malicious* label this bot had been given (ty Yonom) because of the auto-updater using an unreliable host.

### Changes
Unlike other updates that have been made to this bot, v2.1.0 focuses more on the .exe file than functionality in Everybody Edits.

Here is the list of changes made in this update:
- A different fill algorithm (you'll see this change in almost every update now until I perfect it)
- A new admin command: `.kicklol \<player> \<reason>`. This kicks a player and immediately forgives them.
- Admins can no longer ban the owner (I should've done this sooner)
- The bot asks you if you want to enable the auto-updater
- Update-checking is less buggy

The bot has a Git repository now! (aka the one you're viewing rn)
