# Bot1448
This is the Git repo for Bot1448. It contains all the source code for the bot. The bot is published under an MIT License, so you can use its code as long as you provide proper credit to the creator (aka me).

I made this especially for all those control freaks out there who think my bot is unsafe.

## Upcoming version
This is a compulsory update and fixes most existing update bugs. Unfortunately, this includes a bug in the installer, so you have to re-install the bot for it to function properly :(
